1. What is Data Types in Java?
Data Types in Java are defined as specifiers that allocate different sizes and types of values that can be stored in the variable or an identifier.
Java has a rich set of data types.
Data types in Java can be divided into two:-
they are
Primitive Data Types :- which include integer, character, boolean, and float
Non-primitive Data Types :- which include classes, arrays and interfaces.

2. arthematic opertions in java?
  + This operator is used to add the values.
  - This operator is used to subract the values.
  * This operator ia used to perfrom multiplicaton.
  / This operator is used to person divide between 2 values.

3.What is  Casting in Java programming language?
  Casting is used to convert primitive values from one data type to another.
 ex:i.an int value can be assigned to  float data type.
   ii.double value can be assigned to an int data type.
  Casting can be  implicit or explicit.
 i.implicit casting the conversion happens automatically, without writing specific code to do the conversion.
   implicit casting happens when you convert or assign a smaller value, like a byte,to a larger data type such as an int.

 ii.Explicit casting code has to be specifically written to perform the conversion from one primitive type to another.
    Explicit casting is done by using the syntax (data_type) where data_type is the datatype that the cast is being applied.
